## Projects and Experience

### Adaptive Cruise Control (2024 - Present)
Developing and implementing **PID** and **MPC** controllers for Adaptive Cruise Control (ACC) in vehicles, with a focus on maintaining stability and performance under varied traffic scenarios.

### Safe Navigation for Mobile Robots
As a Research Intern at **RBCDSAI, IIT Madras**, I implemented **Control Barrier Functions** and developed a **Model Predictive Controller (MPC)** for multi-robot navigation, ensuring both static and dynamic obstacle avoidance.

### Machine Learning for Stability Lobe Diagrams
Applied **Bayesian Learning** and **Continuous Learning** methods to improve model accuracy and prevent catastrophic forgetting, enabling efficient SLD generation with limited data.

### Self-Balancing Robot
Led a team to design and program a self-balancing robot using **PID control** to maintain stability, a project that helped solidify my interest in robotics and control systems.

## Relevant Coursework
- Reinforcement Learning
- Introduction to Motion Planning
- Computer Vision
- Mechanics of Serial Robots

## Extracurriculars
I enjoy playing **badminton** and have a **black belt in karate**. I also actively participate in **Ultimate Frisbee** tournaments and was a member of my institute's runner-up team.
